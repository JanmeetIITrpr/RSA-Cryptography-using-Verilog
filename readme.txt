Idea 1- Clap Controlled Switch
Group-Janmeet Singh Makkar(2020csb1175) & Prakhar Saxena(2020csb1111)

Overall Objective- This idea puts into use the utility of d flip flops that were taught in our class for home automation , where we can use the sound of our clap to trigger any electronic device.

Implementation â€“ It would be implemented as RTL using Condenser Mic,555 Timer IC, Transistor BC547,Resistors (1k, 47k, 100k ohm),Capacitor (10uF),IC7474 more precisely DM74S74N (D-type flip flop) ,LED and Battery (5-9v)
Functionality- Here we are using Electric Condenser Mic for sensing the sound, transistor to trigger the 555 timer IC, 555 IC to SET & RESET the D-type flip flop and D-type flip flop to remember the logic level (LED ON or OFF) until next Clap/sound.

Idea 2-
Water Level Control Mechanism

Overall Objective - This idea utilizes digital logic to control the
water flow in the pump in accordance with the current water level
in the tank.This would detect and stop water pump when water level is full.

RTL or Software - It would be implemented as RTL using IC4017
counter and a few NOT gates.

Functionality - An automatic water level controller is a device
which senses undesired low and high water levels in a tank, and
switches a water pump ON or OFF accordingly to maintain an
optimal water content in the tank. A water-tank fill-up and
overflow control mechanism with alarm. A circuit will be designed
that displays the present level of water in the tank. The circuit also
opens an outlet valve when the level in the tank exceeds a
particular level, and finally opens the inlet valve when the water in
the tank falls below a particular level.
