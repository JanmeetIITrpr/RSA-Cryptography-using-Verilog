RSA Cryptography 

Our project is based on verilog implementation of RSA encryption , it is a widely known cybersecurity practice which involves 
use of public and private keys (cryptography). to calculate decryption key 'd' and encryption key 'e' we use extended euclidian algorithm  
i.e  d * e = 1 mod (phi)
